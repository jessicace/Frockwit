* Database Implications
- It was initially envisaged that there would be two distinct
  entities, the *Brand* and the *Influencer*, and they would have very
  different goals. Through surveying brands and influencers, they are
  more homogenous and their goals are not so divided. Thus, at this
  stage, the User model was created, rather than a Brand model and an
  Influencer model.
- Polymorphism will be useful for the social media accounts - however,
  time is of the essence in a hackathon, so at the moment they are not
  connected.
